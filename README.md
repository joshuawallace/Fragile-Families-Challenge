# HW 2 for COS 424: Fundamentals of Machine Learning

The focus of this homework was the (Fragile Families Challenge)[http://www.fragilefamilieschallenge.org/].  Using data from an ongoing 
survey (15 years and counting), we were tasked with predicting children outcomes and performance at 15 years old given previous years' data, 
using machine learning techniques.
